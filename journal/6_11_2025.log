Been having a really hard time getting requests to work

Today, I:
    - Battled with trying to get requests to work

Tommorow, I plan to:
    - work on getting a README.md until the weekend comes

Going forward, I plan to:
    - get the standard exchange working then go one by one on the options

just gotta keep plugging away to get requests messages going.
