Last two days was definitely harder than the 6th but I think that things are going pretty well now. I am gonna start
trying to get the client to repsond to advertisement messages.

Today, I:
    - I got the server repsonding to the client solicit with a valid reply
    - I tested the solicits with the unit test
    - I got a "router" set up. (really just a relay agent with radvd)
    - I got elapsed time working

Tommorow, I plan to:
    - Work on requests. pretty much all I plan to do probably the next few days.

Going forward, I plan to:
    - I really would like to get a readme.md going, better then what I currently have. 
    I kind of what to postpone this until the handshake is complete
    - cleanup git commit history
    - continue on the longerterm path of getting the handshake working
    - continue to improve repo structure

just gotta keep plugging away to get requests messages going.
