today went really well. I was quite shocked that I was able to get as much done today as I did. 
Really did not have many difficult bugs today. I am quite excited to see where this project goes

Today, I:
    - Implemented some more bash scripts to speed up development
    - Started thinking about testing
    - Implemented IA options in the solicit
    - got rapid committ and reconfigure accept added into the solicit
    - Even more code cleanup
    - fixed some bugs
    - confirmed that a kea-server will respond with an advertisement (all be it, it had a noaddr status code)

Tommorow, I plan to:
    - I really would like to get a readme.md going, better then what I currently have.
    - elapsed time values I think might not be calculated correctly. need to look into that.
    - get started on testing for the solicits. Figure out how testing is going to work for this project
    - write some unit tests where possible for some of the "standard library functions"

Going forward, I plan to:
    - cleanup git commit history
    - continue on the longerterm path of getting the handshake working
    - continue to improve repo structure

I am glad I got solicits working for this project. Now that it is complete I am going to start testing tommorow.
