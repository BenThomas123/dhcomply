I am gonna start keeping a journal through out this project. That way everyone knows where I am at in this project.
Probably going to update this every "work day" on this project

Today, I:
    - Implemented a bash script to cut down from 3 commands to 1 when I need to rerun the script
    - I implemented ORO completely. 

Tommorow, I plan to:
    - clean up and organize the code/commit history
    - If time I plan to try to tackle IA options

I want to get the solicit working perfectly then move on to advertisement.
